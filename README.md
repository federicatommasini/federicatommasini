I am Federica Tommasini and I am a Computer Science and Engineering Graduate at Politecnico di Milano. During my studies I became passionate about software design and development and I have worked on several projects that allowed me to discover different technologies.

### ðŸŽ“ Education:
- Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
- Bachelor of Science in Electronic and Computer Engineering at UniversitÃ  Degli Studi di Trieste
- Erasmus experience at Chalmers Univeristy in Gothenburg to develop my master's thesis

### ðŸ“Œ Master's Thesis: 
- "Automatic Feedback in Continuous Requirements Engineering Activities" <br>
I have integrated the **TReqs Critics** feature in the open-source, Git-based, textual requirements engineering tool TReqs. My work is not yet in the master branch, but can be found at [this branch of the GitLab repository.](https://github.com/federicatommasini/federicatommasini/assets/92727762/7dfd148d-161d-41b9-8484-6306fa4e0cfb)

### ðŸ”Ž Projects:
 - In my software engineering journey, I've undertaken diverse projects spanning web and mobile application   development, distributed systems, and database management. Through engaging in diverse software development projects, I've refined my skills in software design, development, database management and testing methodologies.
